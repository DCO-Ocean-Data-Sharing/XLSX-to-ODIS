    "description": "This project will produce billions of new ocean observations that benefit the coastal ocean and the species and economies that depend on it. It will create a network of citizen science scuba divers who automatically collect environmental data whenever and wherever they dive, and will share those data openly to enhance condition monitoring and scientific research. A low-cost, oceanographic device that attaches to a scuba diver’s gear and automatically observes and transmits conductivity, temperature, depth and light (CTD-L) will be built. Sustained engagement with diving interests in the identified action geographies will cultivate stakeholder awareness and participation, and participants will be included in the end-to-end process through an interactive web service, citable data, and feedback from scientists, conservation managers, and environmental agencies. This Decade Action is designed to be scaled globally and continue indefinitely beyond the Action’s identified timeframe.",
