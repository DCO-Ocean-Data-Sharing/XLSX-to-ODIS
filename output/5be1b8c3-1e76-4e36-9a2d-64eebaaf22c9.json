GIRT members agree to share their collected data with the broader public to increase awareness of the threats to the UCH non-renewable resource from natural (mechanical, chemical, or biological) or anthropogenic activity. GIRT members share their data with the relevant UCH management agency to strengthen their science-based decision-making capacity.",
